# Signverse

Signverse is an AI-powered communication platform designed to help deaf and non-speaking individuals communicate using hand gestures.  
The system enables **gesture-to-words**, **text-to-gesture**, and **real-time text-to-speech** conversion, making communication more inclusive and interactive.

To make learning engaging, Signverse also includes a **small training game** that helps users practice and improve their gesture recognition skills.
